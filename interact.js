I hail from </b>Bokaro Steel City,Jharkhand</b>. I enjoy <i>listening to music, learning new things and reading books</i>. I can speak <b>Hindi</b> & <b>English</b>. As far as my coding experience is concerned, I m a <b><i>noob</i></b> by the way. I have learnt <b>C</b> language after I entered my college, before that I had no exposure to coding environment. Learning C from scratch was a bit <i>challenging but very interesting</i>. Other than C, I know little bit about <b>C++</b>.I always give a try to every new language I listen about and would like to mention that I have tried my hands at <b>Java</b> and <b>Python</b> too. I know basics of <b>HTML</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>. My First Year at NITT was spent as a memoir of learning experiences because I have tried my hands on lots of new stuffs. Now, I have applied for <b>Spider Inductions</b> and hope to get inducted into the team. Even if I fail, I'll drive home lots of new stuffs that I'll learn throughout this process. Thank you!";
